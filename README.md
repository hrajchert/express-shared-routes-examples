# Express Shared Routes Examples

> This project has examples of use of the Express Shared Routes Library

This project was created to hold the examples of the [Express Shared Routes](https://github.com/hrajchert/express-shared-routes) Library. I've made it as a separate project to make it more similar to what a real project would do (I dont like `require (..\<project>)`)



#### Basic Example

This is a very basic example use of the library, and its intended to show how to bootstrap it and explain the core elements.

[Basic Example](docs/1-basic.md)

#### Menu Example

This example shows you how to create a simple menu and how to share the routes information to the browser for client side rendering.

[Menu Example](docs/2-menu.md)

#### Menu Example With RequireJS

This builds on top of the <b>Menu Example</b> by loading the library using RequireJS.
